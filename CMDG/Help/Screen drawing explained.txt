If Config.ShowTime is set to true, you will see "Calc frame" and "Draw frame" times under the scene.
These run in separate threads, so only the higher number affects your frame rate.

"Draw frame" means the time it takes to write the Framebuffer as color codes and characters into the console. 
"Calc frame" is everything else: your code, SetPixels, the 3D-engine etc.

The drawing routine checks against the previous frame line by line, and skips unchanged lines, as well as unchanged left and right ends of each line.
Drawing time can therefore vary a lot depending on what the scene looks like.
For example the plasma scene is faster to calculate than draw, while most 3D-scenes are the opposite.
